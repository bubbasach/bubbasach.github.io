            <p>Dear Bubba, bubs, bubble-guppy, bubba-gum, baby, gugla, guga, shonu, guga, punkin,</p>
            <p>3 months together.</p>
            <p>I had no idea life could ever feel this way. I wake up with new life everyday that you are by my side. Whether we spend the day rotting with familia moderna, or we spend the day rotting with cat reels, I can count on you being next to me, be it rain shine wind sleet snow.</p>
            <p>I found myself developing a new habit this semester. When walking home from my Wednesday morning class, I place a mental bet that when I walk into the apartment, I’ll find you cuddled up with your headphones on looking at god knows what on your laptop. I’ve won that bet every time.</p>
            <p>I’ve been thinking a lot about our banter, and how it’s changed into babying. I know that we’ve both reflected on that and wondered where our zip went. But the more I think about our future, the more natural this whole development seems. We are dynamic, changing individuals. Perhaps even more than average. And what matters isn’t who we are, or what we act like. But who we’re with. And as long as I’m with you, and we are together on this journey that is life, the details don’t bother me.</p>
            <p>You are my forever gal. My one and only. My gorgeous girl.</p>
            <p>I love you forever Meera.</p>
            <p>Love, Neil</p>
